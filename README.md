# M2M DataTalent Program

M2M Tech Connect’s DataTalent is described as a 16-week program supported by *UpSkill Canada* and *Government of Canada* aimed at helping transition into data-driven roles, combining self-directed learning with live support sessions. [web:1]  
The program highlights “12 weeks of AI & ML courses (300+ hours) + 3 capstone projects,” followed by an employer-led Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) experience in the later weeks. [web:1]

# 🎓 M2M DataTalent Capstones (3 Projects)

A curated portfolio of **three** capstone projects built as part of the M2M Tech Connect *DataTalent* journey, designed to showcase practical data/ML skills through hands-on project work. [web:1]  
This repo is organized to make it easy to explore each capstone, reproduce results, and reuse components for future projects. [web:1]

## 🧩 Capstone Projects

The program structure explicitly references Phase 1 (Capstone 1), Phase 2 (Capstone 2), and Phase 3 (Capstone 3), which this repository mirrors. [web:1]  
Each capstone is meant to be portfolio-ready and focused on demonstrating real-world skills. [web:1]

| Capstone | Theme (edit me) | Key skills demonstrated (edit me) | Where to look |
|---|---|---|---|
| 📌 Capstone 1 | Data analysis & insights | EDA, cleaning, storytelling | `./capstone-1/` |
| 📌 Capstone 2 | ML modeling | Feature engineering, model training, evaluation | `./capstone-2/` |
| 📌 Capstone 3 | Specialization | Deep learning / advanced ML / applied AI | `./capstone-3/` |

> Tip: Replace the “edit me” fields with your real project summaries + add screenshots/GIFs to make the repo pop.
